## üåü Featured Projects *(listed from newest to oldest)*  

- ü§ñ [AI-EDA Agent ‚Äì Autonomous Data Analysis](https://github.com/SamLB9/ai-eda-agent): An intelligent agent that performs complete Exploratory Data Analysis automatically in ~2min. Powered by OpenAI's GPT-5, it generates insights, visualizations, and statistical analysis with zero manual intervention. Features include pre-loaded demo datasets (Spotify, Titanic, Video Game Sales), smart visualizations, comprehensive statistical insights, and sandboxed code execution for safety. The system uses LLM-generated Python code executed in a controlled environment, making advanced data analysis accessible to users of all skill levels.
- üßë‚Äçüè´ [Study Coach ‚Äî Streamlit Q&A App](https://github.com/SamLB9/Student_Coach_Q-A): An LLM-powered RAG app that ingests your notes (PDF/TXT/MD), retrieves relevant context, and autonomously generates adaptive quizzes with MCQs and short answers. It grades responses with structured feedback (immediate or end-of-quiz), tracks per-question attempts (including time-to-answer), and leverages memory to avoid repeating past prompts while adapting difficulty based on historical accuracy. A progress dashboard summarizes sessions and highlights frequently missed questions, and the CLI offers the same workflow from the terminal.
- üéì [MSc Dissertation ‚Äì Comparative Analysis of GAN- and Diffusion-Generated Images for Generalizable Deepfake Detection](https://github.com/SamLB9/GAN-vs.-Diffusion-Images): My MSc dissertation at the University of Edinburgh (2024‚Äì2025). I explored shared and distinct visual patterns (color, noise, frequency, texture) of GAN- and diffusion-generated images to address these limitations and inform the design of more generalizable detectors. Results show that diffusion-based training and frequency-domain features improve cross-architecture generalization, paving the way for more robust, lightweight deepfake detection methods.
- üê∂ [Semantic Segmentation on Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://github.com/SamLB9/Semantic-Segmentation-on-the-Oxford-IIIT-Pet-Dataset): Comparative study of segmentation models trained on the **segmentation of cats and dogs**. Evaluated UNet, Autoencoder, CLIP-based, and Prompt-guided architectures on a standardized benchmark. Findings show CLIP-based segmentation leads in accuracy and robustness, UNet remains efficient for lightweight deployment, and prompt-guided models excel in interactive annotation, highlighting key trade-offs between performance, scalability, and usability in real-world vision tasks.
- üîó [RecipeRec+: Graph-based Recipe Recommender](https://github.com/SamLB9/AugmentedRecipeRecommendations): Extended a graph-based recipe recommender by adding ~500 semantic tag nodes and nutritional features to the User‚ÄìRecipe‚ÄìIngredient graph. These augmentations improved personalization and relational modeling, yielding up to +4.9% HitRate@10 and +4.75% NDCG@10 over the state-of-the-art RecipeRec model and outperforming strong baselines (MAGNN, NGCF). Results highlight how domain-specific knowledge (tags + nutrition) strengthens GNN-based recommendation systems.
- üß† [SQL Query Processor (Java)](https://github.com/SamLB9/Implementation-of-a-SQL-query-processor): Built a basic SQL query processor with optimizations for join evaluation and predicate handling. The system extracts join conditions from WHERE clauses and applies them during tuple-nested-loop joins, preventing large intermediate results. It also implements predicate pushdown, projection pruning, selection combination, and early join evaluation, improving efficiency and resource usage while preserving query correctness.
- üí¨ [Trigram_LM: smoothed language-model toolkit](https://github.com/SamLB9/trigram_lm): A lightweight, educational toolkit for building smoothed n-gram language models at the character and word level. Implements Laplace-smoothed trigram models for text generation and perplexity evaluation, with a simple CLI (train, generate, perplexity). Experiments on Europarl show strong reductions in perplexity (char-trigram ‚âà 28 vs. word-trigram ‚âà 72k), making it a practical baseline for fast prototyping and teaching classical NLP methods.
- üíä [Imputation Methods & Models Research for _EasyMedStat_](https://github.com/SamLB9/EMS_research_imputation-models): Comparative study of imputation strategies and ML models on a healthcare dataset with varying sample sizes and missing data rates. Findings show that while no imputation method consistently dominates, regression and multiple imputation perform better with larger datasets, while median/drop imputation is more effective with smaller ones. Random Forest emerges as a robust model for both regression and classification, with overall performance improving as data quantity increases and degrading as missingness grows.
